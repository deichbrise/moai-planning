# Methods of AI Planning Project

This project provides a general planning problem solver framework. 


## Knowledge Representation
It will use a improved version (more developer friendly) description logic. To do this we use concepts and instances of concepts, like T-Box and A-Box in a oop-friendly pattern.

## Solver
For the solver we use a generic agent approach combined with graph algorithms (we use Neo4j as database and Spring Data as Persistence Abstraction) and Choco as CSP Solver.
